# Recruiters.rip.

This is the Next JS app and official branch for the <a href="recruiters.rip">Recruiters.rip</a> platform.

## Configuration

In this repsoitory, we utlize a variety of tools for the application, which includes:

- React.
- Yarn, for package management.
- React Storybook.
- The Next JS Framework.
- TypeScript
- ESlint for Linting.

## Contributing

This repository houses two branches which are:

Development.
Master.
Production.
Please read through carefully, as so to prevent accidents of any sorts.

The Development Branch is where you should work and make commits to. Then open up a pull request to the Master branch, before it is shipped off to the Production Branch, that is currently deployed. This is to avoid deploying errors, or bugs into the application without automated tests, checks and reviews being done. Please do not push to any other branch, except Development.

Preferably, you should create a custom branch, named after the completed task and merge/create a PR to development.
