# App

Web app for `recruiters.rip`.

## Tech Stack

- NextJS
- Tailwind
- Storybook

## Setup

- install deps: run `yarn`
- init husky: `npx husky install`
  - run tests/lints locally during commits/push (make ci happy)
- install madge globally: `npm i -g madge`
  - this checks for circular dependencies
  - install it globally so we won't pollute package.json

## Todo

- setup testing + coverage + ci (deferred until discussed)
